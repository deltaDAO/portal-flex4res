      "body": "The European research project Flex4Res (Data spaces for FLEXible production lines and supply chains FOR RESilient manufacturing) aims to improve the resilience of supply chains. Therefore, it provides an open platform for secure and sovereign data exchange along the supply chain to support production networksâ€™ reconfiguration for resilient manufacturing value chains. Additional toolboxes for resilience assessment and reconfiguration planning enable stakeholders across the supply chain to manage different types of disruptions by quickly and efficiently reconfiguring supply chains and production lines.",
